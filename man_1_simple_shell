.SH SYNOPSIS
.B simple_shell 
[command] [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Simple_shell
is an UNIX command line interpreter made in C.
This shell can display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed. Simple_shell also works in interactive mode and non-interactive mode.
.SH OVERVIEW
The Simple_shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the terminal, interprets them, and generally exe‐
cutes other commands. It is the program that is running when a user logs into the system.It incorporates many features to aid interactive use and has the advantage that the interpretative language is common to both interactive and non-interactive use (shell scripts).
That is, commands can be typed directly to the running shell or can be put into a file and the file can be exe‐
cuted directly by the shell.
.SH BUGS
- No known bugs.
